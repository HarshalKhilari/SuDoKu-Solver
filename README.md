# SuDoKu-Solver
Put in the given values, and out pops the solved grid!

Have you ever seen a SuDoKu puzzle in the newspaper, told yourself that it would be easy-peasy for you, but once you get to solving it, it takes longer than expected. You know you could solve it, but the brain power you're spending on this could be better used on binging your latest favorite show. 
We've all been there!
And that is why I've built this program, so you can get the solution within a fraction of a second, without the pesky issue of actually solving it!!!
